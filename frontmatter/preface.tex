This report has been prepared by 7th semester Software Engineering students at Aalborg University, during the fall-semester of 2014.
It is expected of the reader to have a background in IT/software, due to the technical content.

References and citations are done by the use of numeric notation, e.g. \cite{civitas-archimedes}, which refers to the first item in the bibliography.

In the report, this project will henceforth be referred to as \projectname.
Whenever the report refers to 'we', it is to be understood as the members of the project group sw701e14.

Finally, we would like to thank our lecturers, and an especially big thanks to our supervisor Giovanni Bacci, for his excellent supervision throughout the semester.
