\section*{Initial Problem Statement}

The current system does not keep track of the bikes[\cref{interviewReferat}]. It is therefore impossible to infer anything about the whereabouts or the usage patterns of the city bikes.

We will therefore solve the following problem:\\\\
\textit{How to provide Aalborg Kommune with information, about the whereabouts and usage patterns of city bikes, through a web service?}
