To counter the increasing energy and environmental issues, Aalborg Kommune implemented the CIVITAS-ARCHIMEDES project\cite{aalborgbycyklenbagcyklen}. As part of this project, city bikes were made publicly available for everyday use.
In order to maximize the number of users, the usage was cheap and easy but the bikes were well equipped and was of good quality\cite{cykelplanlaegning}.
To use a bike all you need to do is to place a 20DKK coin into a bike lock. When your ride is over and you lock the bike at the station, you will get your 20DKK back.
