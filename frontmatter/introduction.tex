To counter the increasing energy and environmental issues, Aalborg Kommune implemented the CIVITAS-ARCHIMEDES project\cite{aalborgbycyklenbagcyklen}. As part of this project, city bikes were made publicly available for everyday use.
In order to maximize the number of users, the usage was cheap and easy but the bikes were well equipped and was of good quality\cite{cykelplanlaegning}. The only payment needed is a 20DKK deposit, which will be returned at the end of the ride.
