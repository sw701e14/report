\section{Web Service API}
The web service API was implemented using ASP.NET Web API 2.3.\cite{aspnet_webapi}

ASP.NET Web API uses ASP.NET MVC.
In this context, \textit{Model} is simply used to describe the resource representations, as the real model is already found in \texttt{Data}'s model.
\textit{View} is the serialized resource representation that the user can obtain by performing requests against the API.
\textit{Controller} represents the handling of resources, which primarily consists of transforming the actual model, into the resources to be returned as response to requests.

The web service API also follows the criteria set by ROA, as described in \cref{webservice:roa}.

\subsection{Resources}

% Command for displaying url, properties, and sub-resource of each resource
\newcommand{\resource}[3]{\begin{description}
\item[URL:]{\texttt{#1}}
\item[Properties:]{\texttt{#2}}
\item[Resources:]{\texttt{#3}}
\end{description}}

\subsubsection{Root}
\resource{/}{version}{availablebikes, hotspots, bikes}
The root path \texttt{/} serves as the entry point for the API.
It has a single property; current version, and a sub-resource for each actual resource.

\subsubsection{Available Bikes}
\resource{/availablebikes}{count}{\{bikeId\}}
This resource contains a list of all available bike resources, along with a count of how many available bikes there are.

\paragraph{Available Bike}
\resource{/availablebikes/\{bikeId\}}{latitude, longitude}{}

\subsubsection{Hotspots}
\mikael{Not implemented yet}
\resource{/hotspots}{hotspots}{}

\subsubsection{All Bikes}
\mikael{Not implemented yet}
\resource{/bikes}{count}{{bikeId}}

\paragraph{Bike}
\resource{/bikes/{bikeId}}{latitude, longitude, immobileSince}{}
