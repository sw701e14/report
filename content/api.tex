\section{Web Service API}
The web service API was implemented using ASP.NET Web API 2.3.\cite{aspnet_webapi}

ASP.NET Web API uses ASP.NET MVC.
In this context, \textit{Model} is simply used to describe the resource representations, as the real model is already found in \texttt{Data}'s model.
\textit{View} is the serialized resource representation that the user can obtain by performing requests against the API.
\textit{Controller} represents the handling of resources, which primarily consists of transforming the actual model, into the resources to be returned as response to requests.

The web service API also follows the criteria set by ROA, as described in \cref{webservice:roa}.

\subsection{Resources}

% Command for displaying url, properties, and sub-resource of each resource
\newcommand{\resource}[5]{\begin{description}
\item[URL:]{\texttt{#1}}
\item[Properties:]{\texttt{#2}}
\item[Resources:]{\texttt{#3}}
\item[Methods:]{\texttt{#4}}
\item[Responses:]{\texttt{#5}}
\end{description}}

\subsubsection{Root}
\resource{/}{version}{availablebikes, hotspots, bikes}{GET}{200 OK}
The root path \texttt{/} serves as the entry point for the API.
It has a single property; current version, and a sub-resource for each actual resource.

\subsubsection{Available Bikes}
\resource{/availablebikes}{count}{\{bikeId\}}{GET}{200 OK}
This resource contains a list of all available bike resources, along with a count of how many available bikes there are.

\paragraph{Available Bike}
\resource{/availablebikes/\{bikeId\}}{latitude, longitude}{}{GET}{200 OK, 404 Not Found}

\subsubsection{Hotspots}
\mikael{Not implemented yet}
\resource{/hotspots}{hotspots}{}{GET}{200 OK}

\subsubsection{All Bikes}
\mikael{Not implemented yet}
\resource{/bikes}{count}{{bikeId}}{GET}{200 OK, 401 Unauthorized}

\paragraph{Bike}
\resource{/bikes/{bikeId}}{latitude, longitude, immobileSince}{}{GET}{200 OK, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found}
