\section{The System}
In the running system the data will be provided by a GPS receiver which will send the calculated location to a GPS location receiver.
The receiver will send at a set interval but it cannot be guaranteed that the interval will be consistent.
It is also not to be guaranteed that the reported GPS locations will be exact.
This will be reported as the accuracy of the measurement by the GPS receiver.

The real system will consist of more than 100 bikes that send GPS points independent of each other.
