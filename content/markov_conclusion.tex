\section{Conclusion}
In order to solve problems 2: \textit{Too few stations} and 4: \textit{No bikes at station}, hotspots were introduced.
These hotspots were found by clustering start/end locations of bike trips.
Then hotspots were simplified by applying convex hull.

Hotspots were also a necessary first step for solving problem 5: \textit{No way of knowing when a bike will arrive}, as they were needed to limit the number of possible states.
After determining the hotspots, and acquiring bike location updates, the model to be used for predictions could be created.

Finally the created model could be used for making predictions, to be served to the user.
