\label{aalborg_bycyklen}
Aalborg Bycyklen is a bike renting service located in Aalborg, Denmark.
It is a public service and available to all visiting and living in the city of Aalborg.
The service is available from the 1st of May to the end of October.\cite{aalborgbycyklenbagcyklen}


\paragraph{Components}
The service consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item An unspecified number of bikes, 
\item 21 bike stations with room for 170 bikes
\end{itemize}
The bikes have a lock that can be used at stations only.
The lock can be unlocked by putting in a coin(20 DKK) and when the bike is locked again the coin is released.

\paragraph{The usage flow}
The usage flow is pretty simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user rents a bike at a station by unlocking it with 20 DKK coin.
\item The user can cycle around.
\item The user is at his end of the tour and stops by a station to lock the bike and collect the 20 DKK coin.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges}\label{aalborg_bycyklen:challenges}
This section will consider the challenges associated with Aalborg Bycyklen.
The challenges described are devised from our own experience and perspective but still considered reasonable.

\paragraph{Bikes disappear}
The low deposit fee leads to many users who feel they do not have the obligation to stop at a station near their destination.
Instead they cycle straight to their destination and leave the bike there.
The obvious problem is that when someone needs a bike they might not find one at a station.
Another problem is that Aalborg Bycyklen has to collect the bikes and return them to the stations.

\paragraph{Flexibility}
The bikes can only be locked at stations.
This means that when a user cycles around and wants to make a stop where there is no bike station he has to leave his bike unlocked.
This entails a risk that someone else takes the bike and the original user has to find another way of transportation, undermining the whole idea of using Aalborg Bycyklen.
The flexibility of Aalborg Bycyklen is therefore deeply dependent on the bike stations and are restricted to areas covered by bike stations.

Another example of flexibility and restriction challenges are areas where there are no bike stations. This will prohibit the user from parking the bike, making it available to other users and retrieve the deposit.

\paragraph{Reliability}
There are two main challenges regarding the reliability of Aalborg Bycyklen:
\begin{itemize}
\item When users want to use a bike, they have to go to a station and see if there are any available bikes.
They have no way of knowing whether there is a bike at a station or not. This could result in the user wasting precious time if he should catch a bus.
\item Lets say a user needs a bike at a specific time in a specific area.
He can not be sure to find a bike at the location at the time. This would force him to use alternative transportation.
\end{itemize}
These challenges show that the primary reason behind this is that the user does not have any knowledge about the bikes availability or whereabouts.

\paragraph{Broken bikes}
When a bike is broken and in need of repair, obviously the users can not use the bike.
Aalborg Bycyklen does not know when a bike is in need of repair and rely solely on the users to report broken bikes.
Potentially there could be bikes left outside the common-usage-area in need of repair. These bikes would be out of service for a long time.
This coupled with the flexibility issues could strictly limit the available bikes.
