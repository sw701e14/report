\section{Making predictions}
As a Markov chain $\mathcal{M}$ can be represented with a matrix $\mathbf{M}$ (constructed from \cref{algo:markov}), we can use $\mathbf{M}$ to give an estimate of the behavior of the average bike in future time-steps.
For this we require an initial probability distribution for the average bike.
We can then apply $\mathbf{M}$ to this distribution to determine the probability of the average bike being in various states after a number to time-steps.
In this section, we will describe how this initial state is established and how we use it to handle predictions.

It should be noted, that the use of the term \textit{''prediction''} in this section refers to determining possible future states of a system, estimated by the Markov chain model.

\paragraph{Notation}
We will introduce some notation in order to describe the various probability distributions of Markov chains.
Let
\begin{itemize}
\item $X_0$ be the random variable representing the possible initial states.
\item $H = \{h_0, h_1, \dots, h_n\}$ be the set of hotspots.
\item $D = \{d_0, d_1, \dots, d_n\}$ be the set of departure states.
\item $S = H \cup D$ be the set of all states.
\item $P_j(h_i) = \mathbb{P}(X_j = h_i)$ and $P_j(d_i) = \mathbb{P}(X_j = d_i)$
\end{itemize}

Additionally we let $P_j$ represent a vector with the probability distribution of the random variable $X_j$.
To formalize this definition, we use the following:

\begin{equation}\label{markov:vector}
P_j = \Big(
P_j(h_0),\;
P_j(d_0),\;
P_j(h_1),\;
P_j(d_1),\;
\dots,\;
P_j(h_n),\;
P_j(d_n)
\Big)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Initial distribution}
The initial probability distribution represents the probability of the \textit{average} bike being in each of the states (hotspots or departure states) in the system.
Thus we can simply examine all the bikes in the system and identify their current location.

The current location of a bike $L(b)$ can be either a hotspot or a departure state; $L(b) \in S$.
The probability of the average bike being in state $s$ will then be equal to the fraction of bikes that are actually in $s$.

Let $B$ be the set of all active bikes in the system and $B_j(s) \in B$ be the set of bikes in state $s$ at time $j$ as described by the model.
$B_0(s)$ will then be the initial set of bikes in state $s$ and we can represent the probability distribution as the following:
\begin{equation}\label{markov:vector:init}
P_0 = \Bigg(
\frac{\lvert B_0(h_0) \rvert}{\lvert B \rvert},\;
\frac{\lvert B_0(d_0) \rvert}{\lvert B \rvert},\;
\frac{\lvert B_0(h_1) \rvert}{\lvert B \rvert},\;
\frac{\lvert B_0(d_1) \rvert}{\lvert B \rvert},\;
\dots,\;
\frac{\lvert B_0(h_n) \rvert}{\lvert B \rvert},\;
\frac{\lvert B_0(d_n) \rvert}{\lvert B \rvert}
\Bigg)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Location of a bike}
Looking at the coordinates of a single bike we are able to determine if it is inside a hotspot or not.
If it is not, we will iterate backwards through the set of known locations of a bike until we find it located in a hotspot $h_i$.
We then say that the bike is currently in state $d_i$.
If there is no data placing a bike within a hotspot the bike will instead be said to be in the departure state of the nearest hotspot.
In this context nearest refers to the hotspot that has the lowest minimum distance to the last known location of the bike.

\paragraph{An example}
With a set of states such as the one in \cref{markov:model:complex} and a total of 16 bikes we could have a distribution of bikes as follows:
8 bikes are currently located in hotspot $H_1$, while 2 bikes have left it, but have not arrived in another hotspot.
They are in departure state $D_1$.
Finally 6 bikes are located in hotspot $H_2$ and none are in its departure state.

Such a distribution of bikes would result in an initial probability distribution of the average bike as below:
$$P_0 = \left(\frac{8}{16}, \frac{2}{16}, \frac{6}{16}, \frac{0}{16}\right)=(0.5, 0.125, 0.375, 0)$$
This distribution will be used to determine future probability distributions of the system.
In the following section this example will be revisited, providing such informations.

\subsection{Predicting from the initial distribution}
Having represented the probability distributions as vectors we can multiply them with matrices.
Multiplying the vector $P_0$ (\cref{markov:vector:init}) with the
