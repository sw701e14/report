\section{Scalability}
Scalability is an important factor when designing a web service.
This is due to the fact that we have high uncertainty in regards to the number of users, so we would like to more easily handle an performance issues due to high user load.
Additionally, we also want to handle an increase in the number of bikes, which itself would lead to an increase in data, thus increasing the complexity of the predictions.
