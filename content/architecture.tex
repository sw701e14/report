\section{Architecture}

The project has been structured in order to make it easier to maintain. 
The overall architecture can be seen on \cref{arch}.

The system is made of five main components, the GPS data source, a GPS data receiver, a database, a library and a web service exposing the functions of this library.

The following will elaborate on the details of these components

\subsection{GPS data source}
The GPS data source is as the name states our source for GPS points.
In the running system this will be the GPS senders on the bikes, but in our system we will simulate the bikes.
More details on the simulation of GPS data can be found in \cref{design:datasimulation}

\subsection{GPS data receiver}
The data receiver will handle each point and insert it into the database. 
The handling of incoming GPS data points is described in \cref{design:datareceiver}.

\subsection{Database}
The database will contain all the data of the running system.
The design of the database can be found in \stefa{databasedesign}.

A wrapper for the database

\subsection{Web service}
