\section{Using R-trees}
R-trees\cite[Section 25.3.5.3]{database_system_concepts} could be introduced to optimize the process of e.g. checking whether bike locations are within hotspot.

\section{API Access}
The API should have different user access levels.
E.g. there should be a user and a maintainer access level.
This means that the maintainer is the only one having access to all bikes location etc.

\section{Data Warehouse \cite{data_warehousing}}
To ease the maintenance of the bikes a data warehouse could be introduced.
A data warehouse would provide statistics of the bike usage, e.g. frequently travelled paths.
These statistics could be used for improving the physical system and the software system.

\section{Model Updating}
This section is about the process of updating the model, described in \cref{}\bruno{ref to 'creating markov chain' section}, especially how often.
There are a lot of trade-off's.. fd,mjg  
Model for all mornings e.g.
model for all weekdays e.g.
etc.

Should the data collected go back to a week, month, year?
