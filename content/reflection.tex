\paragraph{Faster Data Structures}
To optimize the API, a more complex data structure should be introduced.
E.g. the process of checking whether bike locations are within a hotspot would be improved.
R-trees\cite[Section 25.3.5.3]{database_system_concepts} is a data structure that could be chosen for that purpose.

\paragraph{API Access}
The API developed in this project could be used for different purposes and users.
Therefore it would be rather practically to introduce different user access levels.
E.g. there could be the following access levels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Administrator(facilitator of the API)
\item User
\item Bike maintainer
\end{itemize}
This change would be added in the \texttt{Controller} layer in the \texttt{Web Service} component.

\paragraph{Data Warehouse \cite{data_warehousing}}
To ease the maintenance of the bikes a data warehouse could be introduced.
A data warehouse would provide statistics of the bike usage, e.g. frequently travelled paths.
These statistics could be used for improving the physical system and the software system.

\paragraph{Model Updating}
There are some issues regarding the process of updating the model, described in \cref{}\bruno{ref to 'creating markov chain' section} and how often it should be updated.

There are a lot of trade-off's.. fd,mjg  
Model for all mornings e.g.
model for all weekdays e.g.
etc.

Should the data collected go back to a week, month, year?

How many models should be kept and based on what (day, week, time of day) ? How often should models be updated, and from what data (how far back) ?

\paragraph{Accuracy and Convex Hull}
The algorithm that finds the convex hull\cref{}\bruno{ref til convex hull - hvis der kommer et eksplicit afsnit ellers til komponentent hvor det er nævnt} from the clusters, does not take accuracy into account.
This means that some points that should be inside/outside the convex hull are not.
This can give some unexpected results.
When checking if a bike is inside a convex hull, the accuracy is not taking into account either.
