This chapter contains a definition of a hotspot and how we intend to find them based on our data.
It contains theory about the clustering techniques used to group the data into hotspots as well as a section about the convex hull algorithm that we use to create a bounding rectangle to describe the cluster.

\section{Hotspot}\label{hotspot}
We define a hotspot to be an area with a closer density of points compared to the rest of the data.
The points considered have to be static to be a part of the hotspot meaning that we only consider points which has not moved since the last time interval.
