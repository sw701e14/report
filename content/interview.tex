\section{Interview 10-10-2014}
\paragraph{Structure and participants}
The interview was a semi-structured interview. 
It was conducted by group SW707E14 and group SW705E14.
The interviewees were:
\begin{itemize}
\item Brian HÃ¸j; Responsible for the Aalborg Bycykel project.
\item Jesper; Employee at Aalborg Bycykel.
\item Anne Mette; Member of the original team which implemented the CIVITAS-ARCHIMEDES project.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Goals and needs}
There is no target group for the usage of the bikes.
The only goal is that the bikes should be used for single trips and not for longer periods or in place of a personal bike.


\paragraph{Users and usage}
The bikes are currently not tracked so they were not able to say anything about the actual usage.
The only information they have is what they themselves observe when they walk around town and what citizens report.

One of the interviewees have observed many bikes at schools and universities.
Therefore they suppose the average user is young.
They further interpret it as the bikes are used as a replacement for a personal bike.
