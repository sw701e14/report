\section{Generating Markov Chain}\label{sec:generatemarkov}
The Markov chain is generated by doing the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fetches GPS data from the database(by requesting the DAL for it?).
\item Truncates the database, so all data is wiped.
\item Clusters the GPS data with a DBSCAN algorithm.
\item Generates Hotspots by applying a Convex Hull\cite[page 1031]{aadbook} algorithm on the clusters.
\item Generates Markov chain from the Hotspots.
\item Stores GPS data, Hotspots, and Markov chain in the database.
\end{enumerate}
