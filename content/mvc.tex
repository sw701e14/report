MVC or Model View Controller\citet{aspmvc} is used to separate responsibility of an application into three parts, the model, the view, and the controller.
The pattern can be seen as an architecture diagram on \cref{mvcdiagram}.

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Model}] The model contains the model of the application domain and takes care of fetching data and making them available through the model.
\item[\textbf{View}] View displays the model to the user.
\item[\textbf{Controller}] The controllers handle the interaction with users. Based on userinput the controller works on the model and selects what the view needs to be used for displaying the data.
\end{itemize}
