\section{Convex Hull}\label{convex_hull}
In order to check whether a location is within a hotspot, we need to represent hotspots as something different than a cluster of locations.
Instead of doing this with a simple geometrical shape, as this could misrepresent complexly shaped hotspots, we represent a hotspot as a polygon by applying convex hull to the clustered locations.
This way we reduce the amount of locations needed to represent a hotspot, and without any loss of information.

The following definition of convex hull is based on \citet[section 33.3]{aadbook}.

Given a set of points the smallest convex polygon for which each of the points in the set are either on the border of the polygon or inside it is called the convex hull\cite[33.1-5]{aadbook}.
The convex hull is represented by a set of points.
Graham-Scan\cite[page 1031]{aadbook}, an algorithm for finding the convex hull, has been implemented.


\section{Conclusion}

This chapther has examined how we would like to create hotspots for use in our model of the bike system.
For clustering of the data we have chosen to use the DBSCAN algorithm and then afterwards run the Graham Scan convex hull algorithm in order to make a minimal representation of the cluster.
The resulting convex hull is then the hotspot to be used when predicting the movement of the bikes.
