\section{Shared}
As mentioned this component contains two layers, the \texttt{Data Access Layer}(DAL) and the \texttt{Data Transfer Objects}(DTO) layer.
This components responsibility is to share data to other components by using the shared DTO's.
This component is used by the following layers; \texttt{Data Collector}, \texttt{Model} and \texttt{Model Updater}.

\paragraph{The DAL} contains the methods for reading and writing to the chosen database.
The DAL is used by layers to update and retrieve data from the database.

\paragraph{The DTO} layer contains objects used across the architecture so it is easier to move data around using the DAL.
