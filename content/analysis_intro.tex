In order to explore the current problems and shortcomings of the current \citybike system, a short analysis was carried out.

The first step was establishing contact with Aalborg Kommune, in order to learn more about the system as it is now, and what is to come of the system.
This was done through an interview.

Based on the interview, and other sources, the current system was described and analysed.
The problems were identified and defined.

Then other, already existing, systems were examined, in order to draw inspiration.

Finally, based on this analysis, a problem statement was defined.
