This project had the goal of improving the current \citybike system.
Our solution involved equipping all bikes with a GPS receiver. we could then construct a software system that helped solved the problems stated in \ref{aalborg_bycyklen:challenges} as well as the new problems that arose, stated in \ref{new_problems}.

We have in this report successfully solved these problems, and as stated in \ref{chap:test} both our clustering and predictions work as intended.
Thus the project is considered to fulfill the problem statement.

It should be noted that we have only tested on simulated data.
Even though we have tried our best to mimic the real world, it can not be concluded whether the system would work as well in the real world setting.
