This project had the goal of improving the current \citybike system.
Our solution involved equipping all bikes with a GPS receiver. We could then develop a software system that helped solve the problems, stated in \ref{aalborg_bycyklen:challenges}, as well as the new problems that arose, stated in \ref{new_problems}.

We have in this report described how we successfully solved these problems and, as stated in \Cref{chap:test}, both our clustering and prediction methods works as intended.
Thus the project is considered to fulfill the problem statement.

It should be noted that we have only tested on simulated data.
Even though the simulated data is carefully crafted to mimic real world data, we cannot ensure with a 100\% certainty, that real world data always will fall inside the simulated parameters. Thus we cannot conclude that the system would work as expected in a real world setting.
